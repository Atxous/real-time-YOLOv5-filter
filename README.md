# real-time-YOLOv5-filter
Modified Wasserstein Cycle GAN for good training and fast predictions in YOLOv5 model.

I decided to omit the other generator and discriminator. It would take way too long and would be inefficient. I know that doesn't really make
it a Cycle GAN anymore, but I still used the architecture, so I decided to keep it.

# Creation
I originally tried to make my own object detector. That proved to be horrible and went wrong because I lack the proper experience for
localization during live video. So I gave up on that. I used YOLOv5 as an alternative. While looking at GANs, I needed something that
would do style transfer and was lightweightï¼Œso I settled on the CycleGAN for style transfer which I would modify to make it quicker.

Further, I wanted to use a Wasserstein loss function in order to maximize efficiency. The last time I used BCE, it wasn't very good and
training was kind of unstable.

That brings this all to the FCWGAN, meaning the Fast Cycle Wasserstein GAN. This was a tough project. And I mean really tough. And the result
is something that I'm still not completely satisfied with. Partly because of my styled data. But maybe I'll reuse this project another time.

Other than that, photos that I just needed for training are from "I'm something of a painter myself" dataset."
